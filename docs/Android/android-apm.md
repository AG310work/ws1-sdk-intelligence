Whenever an app makes a network call, Omnissa Intelligence SDK can monitor and capture certain network information. You can optionally configure filtering and location details. For an introduction and implementation guidance, see [Network Insights](../../dev-centre/ws1-intel/core-capabilities.md#hnetwork-insights-overview) and [Network Instrumentation](network-instrumentation.md).

When Network Insights is implemented, the Network Performance Monitoring of HTTP traffic generated by either `java.net.HttpURLConnection`, `java.net.HttpsURLConnection`, or `OkHttp` will be monitored.

## Filtering Captured Data

By default, all URLs are stripped of query parameters before being sent to Omnissa Intelligence. For example the URL `www.yoururl.com/login?secret=foobar` would be reported as `www.yoururl.com/login`. It is also possible to add url denylists to completely prevent sensitive URLs from being sent to Omnissa Intelligence. See [CrittercismConfig](crittercism-config.md) for further information.

## Denylisting URLs

URL denylisting can be used to prevent sensitive URLs from being captured by the network instrumentation. Use [CrittercismConfiguration.setURLDenylistPatterns()](crittercism-config.md#seturldenylistpatterns-patterns) for configuring URLs that should not be monitored by Omnissa Intelligence SDK. This configuration option must be set at initialization time of Omnissa Intelligence.

Updating the Location
Network Insights can tie location information to network data, if the application provides the location. By default, location information is not obtained by Omnissa Intelligence SDK.

You can update location information by using the [Crittercism.updateLocation (Location)](crittercism.md#updatelocation-curlocation) method.
